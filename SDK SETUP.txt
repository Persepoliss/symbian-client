ADDITIONAL SDK SETUP
====================

In order to successfully build a Buddycloud client additional files need to be 
included into your S60 SDK directory. 

These files include build definitions and additional SDK API Plugin files provided by Nokia.


These files can be copied from the "addition sdk includes" directory.

Open the directory of the SDK in use, then copy the "epoc32" directory to the root of your SDK directory.
